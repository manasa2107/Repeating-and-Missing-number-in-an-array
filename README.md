# Repeating-and-Missing-number-in-an-array
We are provided with an unsorted array of size n. Array elements are in range from 1 to n. One number from set {1, 2, â€¦n} is missing and one number occurs twice in array. Our goal is to find these two numbers. For example -
Input:
arr = [3,1,3]
Output:

Missing: 2, Repeating: 3

We can see that in this array, 2 is missing and 3 occurs twice.
